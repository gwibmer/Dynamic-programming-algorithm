# Dynamic-programming-algorithm 07/21/2022

For this project, I developed an efficient algorithm to assemble a set of extendable teeth. The solution utilized a dynamic array data structure to optimize the fitting process and ensure the final result met the specified requirements. The algorithm was designed to be flexible and scalable, making it suitable for use in a variety of applications. The project provided an opportunity to demonstrate my skills in algorithm design and implementation, as well as my understanding of dynamic arrays and their applications in real-world problems. 07/21/2022.
